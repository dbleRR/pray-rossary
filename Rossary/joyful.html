       <blockquote>
            <p>Queen of th Holy Rosary, you have deigned to come to Fatima to reveal to the three shepherd children the treasures of grace hidden in the Rosary. Inspire my heart with a sincere love of this devotion, in order that by meditating on the Mysteries of our Redemption which are recalled in it, I may be enriched with its fruits and obtain peace for the world, the conversion of sinners and of Russia, and the favor which I ask of you in this Rosary. (Here mention your request.) I ask it for the greater glory of God, for your own honor, and for the good of souls, especially for my own. Amen</p>

                    he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth. He was sent to a man named Joseph, of the family of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</p><p>The angel came to her and said,"Rejoice, full of grace, the Lord is with you." Mary was troubled at these words, wondering what this greeting could mean.</p><p>But the angel said, "Do not fear, Mary, for God has looked kindly on you. You shall conceive and bear a son and you shall call him Jesus. He will be great and shall rightly be called Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the kingdom of David, his ancestor; he will rule over the people of Jacob forever and his reign shall have no end." </p><p>Then Mary said to the angel, "how can this be if I am a virgin?" And the angel said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; there-fore, the holy child to be born shall be called Son of God. Even your relative Elizabeth is expecting a son in her old age, although she was unable to have a child, and she is now in her sixth month. With God nothing is impossible."</p>

He has acted with power and done wonders, and scattered the proud with their plans. He has put down the mighty from their thrones and lifted up those who are downtrodden. He has filled the hungry with food things but has sent the rich away empty. He held out his hand to Israel, his servant, for he remembered his mercy, even as he proised our fathers, Abraham and his descendants forever."

<blockquote>
    <p>At that time the emperor issued a decree for a census of the whole empire to be taken. This first census was taken while Quirinus was governor of Syria. Everyone had to be reg-istered in his own town.</p><p>So everyone set out for his own city; Joseph too set out from Nazreth of Galilee. As he belonged to the family of David, being a descendant of his, he went to Judea to David's town of Bethlehem to be registered with Mary, his wife, who was with child.</p><p>They were in Bethlehem when the time came for her to have her child,and she gave birth to a son her first-born. She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in the manger, becasue there was no place for them in the living room.</p><p>There were shepherds camping in the countryside, taking turns to watch over their flocks by night. Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared to them with the Glory of the Lord shining around them.</p><p>As they were terrified, the angel said to them, "Don't be afraid; I am here to give you good news, great joy for all the people. Today a Savior has been born to you in David's town; he is the Messiah and the Lord. Let this be a sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger."</p><p>Suddenly the angel was surronded by many more heavenly spir-its, praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest; peace on earth for God is blessing humankind."</p><p>When the angels had left them and gone back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let us go as far as Bethlehem and see what the Lord has made, known to us." So they came hurriedly and found Mary and Joseph with the baby lying in the manger. On seeing this they related what they had been told about the child, and all were astonished on hearing the shep-herds.</p><p>As for Mary, she treasured all these messages and continually pon-dered over them.</p><p>The sheherds then returned giv-ing glory and praise to God for all they had heard and seen, just as the angels had told them.</p><p>On the eighth day the circumci-sion of the baby had to performed; he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived.</p>

He looked forward to the time when the Lord would comfort Israel, and he had been assured by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before se-ing the Messiah of the Lord. So he was led into the Temple by the Holy Spirit at the time the parents brought the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law.</p><p>Simeon took the child in his arms and blessed God, saying, "Now, O Lord, you can dismiss your servant in peace, for you have fulfilled you word and my eyes have seen your sal-vation, which you display for all the people to see. Here is the light you will reveal to the nations<br>and the glory of your people Israel." His father and mother wondered at what was said about the child. Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother, "See him; he will be for the rise of fall of the multitudes fo Israil. He shall stand as a sign of con-tradiction, while a sword will pierce your own soul. Then the secret thoughts of many may br brought to light.</p><p>There was also a pro;hetess named Anna, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. After leaving her father's home, she had been seven years with her husband, and since then she had been continually about the Teple, serving God as a widow night and day in fasting and prayer. She was now eighty-four. Coming up at that time, she gave praise to God and spoke of the child to all who look forward to the deliverance of Jerusa-lem.</p>

As they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem searching for him, and on the third day they found him in the Temple, sit-ting among the teachers, listening to them and asking questions. And all the people were amazed at his under-standing and his answers.</p>
                    <p>
        His parents were very surprised when they saw him and his mother said to him, "Son, why have you done thid to us? Your father and I were very worried while searching for you." Then he said to them, "Why were you looking for me? Do you not know that I must be in my Fathers house?" But they did not understand this answer.</p><p>Jesus went down with them, re-turning to Nazareth, and he continued to be subject to them. As for his mother, she kept all these things in her heart.</p><p>And Jesus increased in wisdom and age, and in divine and human favor.</p>
