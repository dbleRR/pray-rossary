<h2><b>Prayer Before The Rosary</b></h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Queen of th Holy Rosary, you have deigned to come to Fatima to reveal to the three shepherd children the treasures of grace hidden in the Rosary. Inspire my heart with a sincere love of this devotion, in order that by meditating on the Mysteries of our Redemption which are recalled in it, I may be enriched with its fruits and obtain peace for the world, the conversion of sinners and of Russia, and the favor which I ask of you in this Rosary. (Here mention your request.) I ask it for the greater glory of God, for your own honor, and for the good of souls, especially for my own. Amen</p>

        <h2><b>Apostles' Creed</b></h2>
       
        <blockquote>
            <p>I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was concieved by the Holy Spirt, born of the Virgin Mary, sufferd under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried; he descended into hell; on the third day he rose again from the dead;
        he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen</p>

<h2><b>The Baptism of the Lord</b>(Matthew 3:13-17)</h2>

    <blockquote>
        <p>At that time Jesus arrived from Galilee and came to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him. But John tried to prevent him, and said, "How is it you come to me: I should be baptized by you!" But Jesus ansered him, "Let it be like that for now that we may fulfill the right order." John agreed. As soon as he was baptized, Jesus came up from the water. At once, the heavens opened and he saw the Spirit of God come down like a dove and rest upon him. At the same time a voice from heaven was heard, "This is my Son, the Beloved; he is my Chosen One."</p>

<h2><b>The Wedding Feast at Cana</b>(John 2:1-11)</h2>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Three days later there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus was also invited to the wedding with his disciples. When all the wine provided for the celebration had been seved and they had run out of wine, the mother of Jesus said to him, "They have no wine." Jesus replied, "Woman, your thoughts are not mine! My hour has not yet come." However his mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you." Nearby were six stone water jars meant for the ritual washing as practiced by the Jews; each jar could hold twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to the sevants, "Fill the jars with water." And they filledthem to the brim. Then Jesus said, "Now draw some out and take it to the steward." So theydid. The steward tasted the water that had become wine, without knowing from where it had come; for only the servants who had drawn the water knew. So, he called the bridegroom to tell him, "Everyone serves the best wine first and when people have drunk enough, he serves that which is ordinary. Instead you have kept the best wine until the end." This miraculous sign was the first, and Jesus performed I at Cana in Galilee. In this way he let his Glory appear and his disciples believed in him.</p>

<h2><b>The Transfiguration</b>(Matthew 17:1-13)</h2>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain where they were alone. Jesus appearance was changed before them: his face shone like the sun and his clothes became bright as light. Just then Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus. Peter spoke and said to Jesus, "Master, it is good that we are here. If you so wish, I will make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." Peter was still speaking when a bright cloud covered them in its shadow, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, the Beloved, my Chosen One. Listen to him." On hearing the voice, the disciples fell to the ground, full of fear. But Jesus came, touched them and said, "Stand up, do not be afraid." When they
raised their eyes, they no longer saw anyone except Jesus. And as they came down the mountain, Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone what they had just seen, until the Son of Man be raised from the dead. The disciples then asked him, "Why do the teachers of the Law say that Elijah must come first?" And Jesus answered, "So it is: first comes Elijah to set everything as it has to be. But I tell you, Elijah has already come and they did not recognize him, but treated him as they pleased. And they will also make the Son of Man suffer."
    Then the disciples understood that Jesus was referring to John the Baptist.</p>

<h2><b>The Institution of the Holy Eucharist</b>(Matthew 26:17-29)</h2>

   <blockquote>
       <p> On the first day of the Festival of the Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and said to him, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?" Jesus answered, "Go into the city, to the house of a certain man, and tell him: The Master says: "My hour is near, and I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples in your house." The disciples did as Jesus had ordered and prepared the Passover meal. When it was evening, Jesus sat at table with the Twelve. While they were eating, Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you: one of you will betray me." They were deeply distressed and asked him in turn, "You do not mean me, do you Lord?" He answered, "He who will betray me is one of those who dips his bread in the dish me. The Son of Man is going as the Scriptures say he will. But as for that one who betrays the Son of Man; better for him not to have been born." Judas, who was betraying him, also asked, "You do not mean me, Master, do you?" Jesus replied, "You have said it." While they were eating, Jesus took bread, said a blessing and broke it, and gave it to his disciples saying, "Take and eat; this is my body." Then he took a cup and gave thanks, and passed it to them saying, "Drink this blood of the Covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. Yes, I say to you: I will not taste the fruit of the vine from now until the day I drink new wine with you in my Father's kingdom."</p>
