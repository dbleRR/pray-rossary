Inspire my heart with a sincere love of this devotion, in order that by meditating on the Mysteries of our Redemption which are recalled in it, I may be enriched with its fruits and obtain peace for the world, the conversion of sinners and of Russia, and the favor which I ask of you in this Rosary. (Here mention your request.) I ask it for the greater glory of God, for your own honor, and for the good of souls, especially for my own. Amen</p>

                he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.

<h2><b>The Resurrection(John 20:1-29)</b></h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Now, on the first day after the sabbath, Mary of Magdala came to the tomb early in the morning, while it was still dark and she saw that the stone blocking the tomb had been moved away. She ran to Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus loved. And she said to them, "They have taken the <em>Lord</em> out of the tomb and we don't know<br> where they have laid him." Peter then set out with the other disciple to go to the tomb. They ran together but the other disciple out ran Peter and reached the tomb first. He bent down and saw the linen cloths<br>lying flat, but he did not enter.Then Simon Peter came following him and entered the tomb; he, too, saw the linen cloths lying flat. The napkin, which had been around his head was not lying flat like the other linen cloths but lay rolled up in its place. Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in; he saw and believed. Scripture clearly said that he must rise from the dead, but they had not yet understood that. The disciples then went home again. Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she bent down to look inside; she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of Jesus had been, one at the head, and the other at the feet. They said, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She answered, "Because they have taken my <em>Lord</em> and I don't know where they have put him."As she said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not recognize him. Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are  you weeping? Who are you looking for?"She thought it was the gardener and answered him, "<em>Lord,</em> if you have taken him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will go and remove him. "Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned and said to him, "Rabboni" -which means, <em>Master</em> Jesus said to her, "Do not cling to me; you see I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them: I am Father, to my God, who is you God. "So Mary of Magdala went and announced to the disciples, "I have seen the <em>Lord,</em> and this is what he said to me. "On the evening of that day, the first day after the sabbath the doors were locked where the disciples were, because of their fear of the Jews, butJesus came and stood in their midst. He said to them, "Peace be with you"; then he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples kept looking at the <em>Lord</em> and were full of joy. Again Jesus said to them, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you." After saying this he breathed on them and said to them" Receive the Holy Spirit; for those whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven; for those whose sins you retain, they are retained. "Thomas, the Twin, one of the Twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples told him, "We have seen the <em>Lord.</em> But he replied, "Until I have seen in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe. "Eight days later, the disciples were inside again and Thomas was with them. Despite the locked doors Jesus came and stood in their midst and said, "Peace be with you."</p>

<h2><b>The Ascension(Luke 24:36-53)</b></h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>As they went on talking about this, Jesus himself stood in their midst.(And he said to them, "Peace to you.")In their panic and fright they thought they were seeing a ghost, but he said to them, "Why are you upset and why dosuch ideas cross your mind? Look at my hands and feet and see that it is I myself. Touch me and see for yourselves that a ghost has no flesh and bones as I have." (As he said this, he showed his hands and feet.)In their joy they didn't dare believe and were still astonished. So he said to them, "Have you anything to eat?" and they gave him a piece fo broiled fish. He took it and ate it before them.Then Jesus said to them, "Re-member the words I spoke to you when I was still with you: Everything written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms had to be fulfilled." Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures. And he went on, You see what was written: the Messiah had to suffer and on the third day rise form the dead. Then repentance and forgiveness in his name would be proclaimed to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem. Now you shall be witnesses to this. And this is why I will send you what my Father promised. So remain in the city until you are invested with power from above. "Jesus led them almost as far as Bethany; then he lifted up his hands and blessed them. And as he blessed them, he withdrew (and was taken to heaven. They worshiped him). They returned to Jerusalem full of joy and were continually in the Temple praising God.</p>

<h2><b>The Descent of the Holy Spirit(Acts 2:1-47)</b></h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. And suddenly out of the sky came a sound like a strong rushing wind and it fulled the whole house where they were sitting. There appeared tongues as if of fire which parted and came to rest upon each one of them. All were filled with Holy Spirit and began to speak other languages, as the Spirit enabled them to speak. Staying in Jerusalem were religious Jews from every nantion under heaven. When they heard this sound, a crowd gathered, all excited because each heard them speaking in his own language. Beside themselves with amazement and wonder, they said, "Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? How is it that we hear them in our own native language? Here are Parthians, Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and vistors from Rome, both Jews and foreigners who accept Jewish beliefs, Cretians and Arabians; and all of us hear them proclaiming in our own language what God, the Savior, does. They were amazed and greatly confused, and they kept asking one another, "What does this mean?" But others laughed and said, "These people are drunk. "Then Peter stood up with the Eleven and, with a loud voice, addressed them, "Fellow Jews and all foreigners now staying in Jerusalem, listen to what I have to say. These people are not drunk as you suppose, for it is only nine o'clock in the morning. Indeed what the prophet Joel spoke about has happened: <em>In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on every mortal.Your sons and daughters will speak through the Holy Spirit; you young men will see visions and your old men will have dreams. In those days I will pour out my Spirit even on my servants, both men and women, and they will bre prophets. I will perform miracles in the sky above and wonders on the earth below. The sun will be darkened and the moon will turn red as blood, before the great and glorous Day of the Lord comes. And then, whoever calls upon the Name of the Lord will be saved.</em>Fellow Israelites, listen to what I am going to tell you about Jesus of Nazareth. God accredited him and through him did powerful deeds and wonders and signs in your midst, as you well know. You delivered him to sinners to be crucified and killed, and in this way the purpose of God from all times was fulfilled. But God raised him to life and released him from the pain of death, because it was impossible for him to be held in the power of death. David spoke of him when he said:<em> I saw the Lord before me at all times; he is by my side, that I may not be shaken. therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced; my body too will live in hope. Because you will not forsake me in the abode of the dead, nor allow your Holy One to experience corruption. You have made known to me the paths of life, and your presence will fill me with joy</em>.Friends, I don't need to prove that the patriarch David died and was buried; his tomb is with us to this day. Him that one of his descendants would sit upon his throne and, as he was a prophet, he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah. So he said that<em> he would not be left in the region often dead, nor would his body experience corruption.</em>This Messiah is Jesus and we are all witnesses that God raised him to life. He has been exalted at God's right side and the Father has entrusted the Holy Spirit to him; this Spirit he has just poured upon us as you now see and hear. And look: David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself said:<em>TheLord said to my Lord: sit at my right side until I make your ememies a stool for you feet.</em> Let Israel then know forsure that God has mde Lord and<br>Christ this Jesus whom you crucified. "When they heard this, they were deeply troubled. And they asked Peter and the other apostles: What shall we do brother?" Peter answered: "Each of you must repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, so that your sins may be forgiven. Then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise of God was made to you and your children, and to all those from a far whom our God may call. "With many other words Peter gave the message and appealed to them saying, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation. "So those who accepted his word were baptized; some three thousand persons were added to their number that day. They were faithful to the teaching of the apostles, the common life of sharing, the breaking of bread and the prayers. A holy fear came upon all the people, for many wonders and miraculous sign were done by the apostles. Now all the believers lived together and shared all their belongings. They would sell their property and all they had and distribute the proceeds to others according to their need. Each day they met together in the Temple area; they broke bread in their homes; they shared their food with great joy and simplicity of heart; they praised God and won the people's favor. And everyday the Lord added to their number those who were being saved.</p>
