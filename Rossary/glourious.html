Inspire my heart with a sincere love of this devotion, in order that by meditating on the Mysteries of our Redemption which are recalled in it, I may be enriched with its fruits and obtain peace for the world, the conversion of sinners and of Russia, and the favor which I ask of you in this Rosary. (Here mention your request.) I ask it for the greater glory of God, for your own honor, and for the good of souls, especially for my own. Amen</p>

<h2><b>The Resurrection (John 20:1-29)</b></h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Now, on the first day after the sabbath, Mary of Magdala came to the tomb early in the morning, while it was still dark and she saw that the stone blocking the tomb had been moved away. She ran to Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus loved. And she said to them, "They have taken the <em>Lord</em> out of the tomb and we don't know<br> where they have laid him." Peter then set out with the otherdisciple to go to the tomb. They ran together but the other disciple outranPeter and reached the tomb first. He bent down and saw the linen cloths<br>lying flat, but he did not enter.Then Simon Peter came following him and entered the tomb; he, too, sawthe linen cloths lying flat. The napkin, which had been around his head was not lying flat like the other linen clothsbut lay rolled up in its plaace. Then theother disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in ; he saw andbelieved. Scripture clearly said that he<br>must rise from the dead, but they hadnot yet understood that. The disciples then went home again.<br>Mary stood weeping outside thetomb, and as she wept she bent downto look inside; she saw two angels inwhite sitting where the body of Jesushad been, one at the head, and theother at the feet. They said, "Woman,why ar eyou weeping?" She answered,"Because they have taken my <em>Lord</em> andI don't know where they have put him."As she said this, she turnedaround and saw Jesus standing there,but she did not recognize him. Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are  youweeping? Who are you looking for?"She thought it was the gardener andanswered him, "<em>Lord,</em> if you have takenhim away, tell me where you have puthim, and I will go and remove him."Jesus said to her, "Mary." Sheturned and said to him, "Rabboni" -which means, <em>Master</em> Jesus said toher, "Do not cling to me; you see I havenot yet ascended to the Father. But goto my brothers and say to them: I am<br>Father, to my God, who is you God."So Mary of Magdala wnt and an-nounced to the disciples, "I have seenthe <em>Lord,</em> and this is what he said toto me."On the evening of that day, thefirst day after the sabbath the doors<br>were locked where the disciples were,<br>because of their fear of the Jews, butJesus came and stood in their midst.He said to them, "Peace be with you";then he showed them his hnds andhis side. The disciples kept looking at the <em>Lord</em> and were full of joy.Again Jesus said to them, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me,so I send you." After saying this he breathed on them and said to them"Receive the Holy Spirit; for those whose sins you forgive, they are for-given; for those whose sins you retain,they are retained."Thomas, the Twin, one of theTwelve, was not with them when Jesuscame. The other disciples told him,"We have seen the <em>Lord.</em> But he re-plied, "Until I have seen in his hands the<br>print of the nails, and put my finger in<br>the mark of the nails and my hand inhis side, I will not believe."Eight days later, the disciples wereinside again and Thomas was withthem. Despite the locked doors Jesuscame and stood in their midst and said,"Peace be with you."</p>

<h2><b>The Ascension (Luke 24:36-53)</b></h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>As they went on talking aboutthis, Jesus himself stood in their midst.(And he said to them, "Peace to you.")In their panic and fright they thoughtthey were seeing a ghost, but he saidto them, "Why are you upset and why dosuch ideas cross your mind? Look atmy hands and feet and see that it is Imyself. Touch me and see for your-selves that a ghost has no flesh andbones as I have." (As he said this, heshowed his hands and feet.)In their joy they didn't dare believeand were still astonished. So he said to them, "Have you anything to eat?"and they gave him a piece fo broiledfish. He took it and ate it before them.Then Jesus said to them, "Re-member the words I spoke to you whenI was still with you: Everything writtenabout me in the Law of Moses, theProphets and the Psalms had to be fulfilled." Then he opened their mindsto understand the Scriptures.And he went on, You see what was written: the Messiah had to suffer and onthe third day rise form the dead.hen repentance and forgiveness in his namewould be proclaimed to all the nations,beginning rom Jerusalem. Now youshall be witnesses to this. And this is why I will send you what my Fatherpromised. So remain in the city until youare invested with power from above."Jesus led them almost as far asBethany; then he lifted up his hands andblessed them. And as he blessedthem, he withdrew (and was taken to heaven. They worshiped him). They returned to Jerusalem full of joy andwere continually in the Temple prais-ing God.</p>

<h2><b>The Descent of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1-47)</b></h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>When the day of Pentecostcame, they were all together in oneplace. And suddenly out of the skycame a sound like a strong rushingwind and it fulled the whole house wherethey were sitting. There appearedtongues as if of fire which parted andcame to rest upon each one of them.All were filled with Holy Spirit andbegan to speak other languages, as theSpirit enabled them to speak.Staying in Jerusalem were religious Jews from every antion underheaven. When they heard this sound,a crowd gathered, all excited becauseeach heard them speaking in his ownlanguage. Beside themselves withamazement and wonder, they said,"Are not all these who are speakingGalileans? How is it that we hear themin our own native language? Here areParthians, Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea andCappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phry-gia, Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts ofLibya belonging to Cyrene, and vistorsfrom Rome, both Jews and foreignerswho accept Jewish beliefs, Cretiansand Arabians; and all of us hear themproclaiming in our own language whatGod, the Savior, does.They were amazed and greatlyconfused, and they kept asking oneanother, "What does this mean?" But others laughed and said, "These people are drunk."Then Peter stood up with the Eleven and, with a loud voice, ad-dressed them, "Fellow Jews and allforeigners now staying in Jerusalem,listen to what I have to say. Thesepeople are not drunk as you suppose,for it is only nine o'clock in the morn-ing. Indeed what the prophet Joelspoke about has happened: <em>In the last days, God says, I willpour out my Spirit on every mortal.Your sons and daughters will speakthrough the Holy Spirit; you youngmen will see visions and your old menwill have dreams.In those days I will pour out mySpirit even on my servants, both menand women, and they will bre prophets.I will perform miracles in the skyabove and wonders on the earth below.The sun will be darkened and themoon will turn red as blood, before thegreat and glorous Day of the Lordcomes.And then, whoever calls upon theName of the Lord will be saved.</em>Fellow Israelites, listen to what Iam going to tell you about Jesus of Nazareth. God accredited him andthrough him did powerful deeds and wonders and signs in your midst, as you well know. You delivered him tosinners to be crucified and killed, and in<br>this way the purpose of God from alltimes was fulfilled. But God raisedhim to life and released him from thepain of death, because it was impos-sible for him to be held in the power ofdeath. David spoke of him when he said:<em> I saw the Lord before me at alltimes; he is by my side, that I may notbe shaken. therefore my heart was<br>glad and my tongue rejoiced; my body<br>too will live in hope. Because youwill not forsak me in the abode of thedead, nor allow your Holy One to expe-<br>rience corruption. You have madeknown to me the paths of life, and yourpresence will fill me with joy</em>.Friends, I dont need to prove thatthe patriarch David died and was bur-ied; his tomb is with us to this day.him that one of his descendants wouldsit upon his throne and, as he was a prophet, he foresaw and spoke of theresurrection of the Messiah. So he saidthat<em> he would not be left in the region ofthe dead, nor would his body experi-ence corruption.</em>This Messiah is Jesus and we areall witnesses that God raised him to life.He has been exalted at God's rightside and the Father has entrusted theHoly Spirit to him; this Spirit he has just poured upon us as you now see andhear.And look: David did not ascendinto heaven, but he himself said:<em>TheLord said to my Lord: sit at my rightside until I make your ememies a stool for you feet.</em> Let Israel then know forsure that God has mde Lord and<br>Christ this Jesus whom you crucified."When they heard this, they weredeeply troubled. And they asked Peterand the other apostles: What shall wedo brother?" Peter answered: "Each of you must repent and be baptized in thename of Jesus Christ, so that your sinsmay be forgiven. Then you will receivethe gift of the Holy Spirit. for thepromise of God was made to you and your children, and to all those from a farwhom our God may call."With many other words Peter gavethe message and appealed to themsaying, "Save yourselves from thiscrooked generation." So those whoaccepted his word were baptized; some three thousand persons were added totheir number that day.They were faithful to the teachingof the apostles, the common life ofsharing, the breaking of bread and theprayers.A holy fear came upon all thepeople, for many wonders and miracu-lous sign were done by the apostles.Now all the believers lived togetherand shared all their belongings. Theywould sell their property and all theyhad and distribute the proceeds to oth-ers according to their need. Each daythey met together in the Temple area;they broke bread in their homes; theyshared their food with great joy andsimplicity of heart; they praised Godand won the people's favor. And everyday the Lord added to their numberthose who were being saved.</p>
