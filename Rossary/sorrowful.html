            <p>
                Queen of the Holy Rosary, you have deigned to come to Fatima to reveal to the three shepherd children the treasures of grace hidden in the Rosary. Inspire my heart with a sincere love of this devotion, in order that by meditating on the Mysteries of our Redemption which are recalled in it, I may be enriched with its fruits and obtain peace for the world, the conversion of sinners and of Russia, and the favor which I ask of you in this Rosary. (Here mention your request.) I ask it for the greater glory of God, for your own honor, and for the good of souls, especially for my own. Amen

                    <blockquote>  
                    <p>
                        Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit here while I go over to pray." He took Peter and the two sons of Aebedee along with him, and he began to be filled with anguish and distress. And he said to them, "My soul is filled with sorrow even to death. Remain here and stay awake with me." He went a little farther and fell to the ground, with his face touching the earth, and prayed, "Father, if it is possible, take this cup away from me. Yet not what I want, but what you want." He went back to his disciples and found them sleep, and he said to Peter, "Could you not stay awake with me for even an hour? Stay awake and pray, so that you may not slip into temptation. The spirit indeed is eager but human nature is weak." He again went away and prayed, "Father, if this cup cannot be taken away from me without my drinking it, let your will be done." When he came back to his disciples, he again found them sleep, for they could not keep their eyes open. He left them and again went to pray the third time, saying the same words. Then he came back to his disciples and said to them, "You can sleep on now and take your rest! The hour has come and the Son of Man is now given over into the power of sinners. Get up, let us go. Look: the betrayer is here." Jesus was still speaking when Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, who had been sent by the chief priests and the Jewish authorities. The traitor had arranged a signal for them: "when I kiss, thy is the man; arrest him." And he went directly to Jesus and said, "Good evening, Master and he gave him a kiss. But Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you came for." Then they laid hold of Jesus and arrested him. One of those who were with Jesus drew his sword and struck at the servant of the High Priest, cutting off his ear. So Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into  place, for he who uses the sword will perish by the sword. Do you know that I could call on my Father, and he would at once send me more than twelve legions of angels. If Scripture says that this has to be, should it not be fulfilled?" At that moment, Jesus said to the crowd, "Why do you come to arrest me with swords and clubs, as if I were a robber? Day after day I was seated among you teaching in the Temple, yet you did not arrest me. But all this has come about in fulfillment of what the Prophets said." Then all his disciples deserted him and fled.

He then asked for water and washed his hands before the people, saying, "I am not responsible for his blood. It is your doing." And all the people answered, "Let his blood be upon us and upon our children." Then Pilate set Baraabbas free, but had Jesus scourged, and handed him over to be crucified.

They spat on him, took the reed from his hand and struck him on the head with it. When they had finished mocking him, they pulled off the purple cloak and dressed him in his own clothes again, and led him out to be crucified.

                        There they crucified him and divided his cloths among themselves, casting lots to decide what each should take. Then they sat down to guard him. The statement of his offense was displayed above his head and it read, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews." They also crucified two bandits with him, one on his right and one on his left. People passing by shook their heads and insulted him, saying, "Aha! So you will destroy the Temple and build it up again in three days. Now save yourself and come down from the cross, if you are Son of God." In the same way the chief priests, the Elders and the teachers of the Law mocked him. They said, "The man who saved others cannot save himself. Let the King of Israel now come down from his cross and we will believe in him. He trusted in God; let God rescue him if God wants to, since he himself said: I am the Son of God." Even the robbers who were crucified with him insulted him. From midday darkness fell over the whole land until mid afternoon. At about three o'clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lamma Sabbacthani?" which means: My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? As soon as they heard this, some of the bystnders said, "He is calling for Elijah." And one of them went quickly, took a sponge and soaked it in vinegar, putting it on a reed, gave him to drink. Others said, "Leave him alone, let us see whether Elijah comes to his rescue." Then Jesus cried out again in a loud voice and gave up his spirit.
